# Troubleshooting(Pre-Assembled)

## General:

  * Do not adjust any jumpers on the BluePill microcontroller itself(the 2 near the USB port).  Those are used for programming the device and can potentially erase the memory

  * If you purchased a kit, first go through the link:troubleshooting-Kit.adoc[Troubleshooting-Kit] document to ensure everything is right with your hardware

 * Remove the SD card, power it just through MicroUSB or the Berg connector.  It should flash 5x which means no SD card found.  If it doesn’t, that means there’s another problem

  * Make sure your termination is set correctly.  If it’s the last device on the SCSI chain, you must have termination enabled by having the 2 jumpers on the BlueSCSI board near the SCSI port and resistor networks.

  * Make sure there are no conflicting SCSI IDs. If possible, remove any other SCSI devices.

  * If you have another computer to try it on, give it a try on there.


## No Power:
Most computers should provide SCSI termination power through the SCSI cable, which is enough to power the Bluepill(Mac Plus is a known exception unless you do a mod), but it’s entirely possible a computer doesn’t for whatever reason.   Unplug the BlueSCSI from the computer’s SCSI Connection and try to power it either through the MicroUSB port on the BluePill, or 5v through the Berg connector.  If it lights up at all, it’s possible you computer doesn’t provide the correct SCSI termination power.  If that's the case, you can get a cheap Molex to Floppy(Berg) power connector and use it that way, or power it through USB

Also ensure that nothing on the BlueSCSI has been shorted out at all.  Any time you’re working on it make sure any headers from components aren’t resting on a conductive surface.


## PC13 LED flashes 3x
This means that no images could be found.

  * Ensure images are named correctly, such as HD10_512.hda .  Verify that there are no hidden file extensions(Windows and Mac OS like to hide file extensions by default).  Ensure its’s not really HD10_512.hda.img for example

  * Use one of the pre-made images on Macintosh Garden - https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/bluescsi

  * Check the LOG.txt file on the root of the SD card, that will show specific details about what the BlueSCSI tried to do


## PC13 LED flashes 5x
This means the SD card cannot be found

  * SD Cards need to be either ExFAT or Fat32 formatted(ExFAT gives better performance).  They must be using MBR, not GPT or Apple partition scheme.  
  * The tool on https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/ tends to work well for resolving formatting issues.  Chose the “Overwrite format” option.
  * If you have another SD card, give that a try.


## PC13 continuously flashes
This could be 2 things.  If it’s running an older version of the BlueSCSI software, that means no SD card found or an image can’t be loaded.  Follow all the troubleshooting steps in the above sections.

It could also mean that it’s running the default “blink” program that often comes loaded on BluePills. If you messed with the jumpers on the BluePill itself, make sure they are both set to the 0 position(Closest to the MicroUSB port).  If you purchased the BluePill yourself, make sure you flashed the software using the https://github.com/erichelgeson/BlueSCSI#flashing[flashing procedure].   
If you purchased a assembled unit or a kit from someone, it should come pre-flashed with the latest software.  Contact who you bought it from.  

## Slow performance

  * Ensure you are using a good SD card. SD card quality can vary widely. 

  * Format your card as ExFat - users have seen quite a jump in performance.
